# Objective
This project is to familiarize you with C++ and
basic data structures - high-dimensional matrices. Here, you will also gain hands-on
experience with classes, constructors, destructors, and various matrix operations. Additionally, you are asked to implement these for a basic image processing task, melding
theoretical knowledge with real-world application.
